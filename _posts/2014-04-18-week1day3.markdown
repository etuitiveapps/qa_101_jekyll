## How to install Ruby On Windows

1. We need to download and install the latest 32 bit versions of [RubyInstaller and DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
+ Install RubyInstaller at C:\Rubyxxx (must be the "C:\" drive, other drives will cause some sophisticated problems in windows).
+ Also note that xxx is the latest 32 bit version of Ruby ( Ruby 193 would be C:\Ruby193, Ruby 2.0.0 would be C:\Ruby200, etc)
+ Extract DevKit.exe to C:\DevKit.

> **How to:** Bind the DevKit to Ruby:
>
> - C:\git> cd \devkit,
> - C:\DevKit> ruby dk.rb init
> - C:\DevKit> ruby dk.rb install --force

You can find more information about the devkit [here](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit)
